# SpartaGlobal2020
The project contains an Application that allows users to choose different sorting algorigthms

The user can choose from 6 different choices 

They will then be asked to input an array size

A random number generator will then generate numbers based on the size defined by the user

The console will then output the unsorted array

The chosen algorithm will then sort the array and display it to the user

By using the time catcher method, it catches the time it took for the algorithm to sort the array.

The user will then see the array is sorted and the time will be displayed in milliseconds below that.
